## Cool stuff accomplished from the challenge

**Search bar at the top and list of results below**
- Clean search field with "Search Pok√©mon..." placeholder
- Results displayed in a scrollable grid below the search bar

**Images sourced from API**
- Uses the official Pokemon API (pokeapi.co) for all Pokemon data and images
- Implements image caching for better performance

**Infinite scroll implementation**
- Automatically loads more Pokemon as you scroll down
- Loads 5 Pokemon at a time for smooth performance
- Includes loading indicators and error handling

**Debounce in search field**
- 500ms delay before search executes to prevent excessive API calls
- Clears previous search when typing new queries

## Things I added for fun

**Pokemon Detail Screen**
- Tap any Pokemon card to view detailed information
- Shows Pokemon stats, abilities, height, weight, and base experience
- Displays Pokemon types with color-coded badges
- Clean, organized layout with consistent styling

**Classic, Friendly Design**
- Used Courier font throughout for a retro, game-like feel
- Solid black borders on all cards and elements
- Type-based color coding (fire = red, water = blue, grass = green, etc.)
- Consistent visual theme that makes the app feel cohesive and fun
