Coding Challenge
This challenge is a prerequisite to interviewing with AppRabbit. We want to see what you
can do in the context of a real project. This isn’t something that should take a lot of your
time. We know you’re busy and we don’t want to add a lot to your plate.
We would like to see this completed within 2 days. Earlier is better! It’s a chance to
demonstrate that you can learn and build quickly.
The coding challenge is a single-page image search app built in Flutter. Here are the
requirements:
• The page should have a search bar at the top and a list of results below.
• Images can be sourced from any API of your choosing.
• Implement infinite scroll, meaning more results should continue to load as you
scroll
• Implement debounce in the search field
• That’s all. You can add more features if you want.
• Send me a link to the code in a public repo on GitHub.
Notes:
• Use your resources. AI and third-party packages are not oN limits.
• You will need to be able to speak about your code and understand what it’s doing.
• Your work will be evaluated on functionality, code quality, thoughtfulness, design
taste, and speed.
• Being able to comment on some things you learned about Flutter in the process will
also be a plus.
This is step one of a two-step process. Once we get this back from you, we’ll have one short
call or meeting to walk through your code, and either hire you or not.
Good luck!
